# About TRLEManager
![TRLEManager Main Window](images/mainwindow.jpg)

TRLE stands for Tomb Raider Level Editor. These are custom Tomb Raider maps built in the classic style.

This manager makes it easy to download, install, and play TRLE games. Keep your TRLEs organized and remove old TRLEs you don't play anymore to free up space.

In addition, this manager provides gamepad support for TRLEs running under the manager. With inspiration drawn from the Tomb Raider I-III Remaster, weapon selection, quick saving and loading has been emulated in the same manner. The gamepad is implemented by simulating key presses. You may fully customize the gamepad to your liking.

Currently, the manager supports downloading from TRLE.net using the TRLE.net ID and TRCustoms.org using the TRCustoms ID. Simply enter the ID into the appropriate field, install, and play the TRLE with controller support!
